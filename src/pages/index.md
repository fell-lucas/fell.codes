# {{ title }}.
### I solve problems with tech.

I'm a software engineering student (7/9 semesters) and junior fullstack developer. Working at [Zallpy Digital](https://zallpy.com/en).

I have a passion for building clean, well-architected software solutions. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects).

Outside of programming, I enjoy taking long walks, being around nature and reading. Lately I've been taking some time to write letters to people around the world through **Slowly**. If you happen to be over there, feel free to write me sometime. My user ID is **WZPP82**.
